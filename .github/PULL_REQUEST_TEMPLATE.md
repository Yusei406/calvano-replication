## Summary
Brief description of changes and their academic motivation.

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality) 
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Performance improvement
- [ ] Academic enhancement (new analysis, validation, etc.)

## Academic Impact
- [ ] Maintains paper target achievement (≥0.18 individual, ≥0.26 joint profit)
- [ ] Improves reproducibility
- [ ] Adds new theoretical insights
- [ ] Enhances computational performance
- [ ] Extends parameter analysis

## Testing
- [ ] Tests pass (`pytest tests/ -v`)
- [ ] Code coverage maintained (≥89%)
- [ ] Numerical regression tests pass
- [ ] Paper targets verified
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility checked

## Code Quality
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines (`black`, `isort`, `ruff`)
- [ ] Type hints added for new functions
- [ ] Docstrings follow Google/NumPy style
- [ ] No performance regression in benchmarks

## Checklist
